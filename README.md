# TCP Chat Application - CSC2030 Final Project

This is a simple TCP-based chat application developed for the final project in **CSC2030: Computer Networks** at Belmont University.

## 📜 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate reliable, real-time communication over a network using **TCP sockets**. The application includes both a server and a client, each with a **Tkinter GUI**, allowing multiple users to exchange text messages on the same network.

## 🖥️ Features
- Real-time messaging between clients
- GUI for both Server and Client built with Tkinter
- Multi-client support via TCP socket programming
- Event-driven interface for intuitive user interaction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** for GUI
- **Socket** library for networking

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JaydenCruz2004/CSC2030-TCP-Chat.git
   cd CSC2030-TCP-Chat

## 🔍 Key Concepts
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of data.
- **Socket Programming:** Enables the server to handle multiple clients and relay messages between them.
- **GUI with Tkinter:** Provides a user-friendly way to send/receive messages.

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add user authentication and display names
- Implement message timestamps
- Enable encrypted messaging via TLS
- Deploy to a cloud server for internet-wide access
